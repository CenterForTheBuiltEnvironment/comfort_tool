abstract = {The Center for the Built Environment (CBE) Thermal Comfort Tool is a free online tool for thermal comfort calculations and visualizations that complies with the ASHRAE 55–2017, ISO 7730:2005 and EN 16798–1:2019 Standards. It incorporates the major thermal comfort models, including the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Standard Effective Temperature (SET), adaptive models, local discomfort models, SolarCal, and dynamic predictive clothing insulation. Our tool also provides dynamic and interactive visualizations of thermal comfort zones. The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool has several practical applications and each year is used by more than 49,000 users worldwide, including engineers, architects, researchers, educators, facility managers and policymakers.}
