#summary Comfort Models API

= Introduction =

This describes comfort model API, consisting of the functions of the `comf` object.

= Details =

===`comf.pmv(ta, tr, vel, rh, met, clo, wme)`===

This function is Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote model.

_Input parameters_:
    * `ta` : Air temperature [°C]
    * `tr` : Mean radiant temperature [°C]
    * `vel` : Air velocity [m/s]
    * `rh` : Relative humidity [%]
    * `met` : Metabolic rate [met]
    * `clo` : Clothing insulation level [clo]
    * `wme` : External work [W/m^2] (typically zero)

_Outputs_ an object with properties `pmv`, and `ppd`, where
    * `pmv` : Predicted mean vote
    * `ppd` : Percent predicted dissatisfied

===`comf.pmvElevatedAirspeed(ta, tr, vel, rh, met, clo, wme)`===
_Input parameters_ as in `comf.pmv`.

_Outputs_ an object with properties:
    * `pmv` : Predicted mean vote
    * `ppd` : Percent predicted dissatisfied
